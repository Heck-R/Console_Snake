# Console_Snake
## Introductory
The average Snake game known by everyone but in the console to make it oldschool
## Setup
The compiled executable version can be found in the build folder. The game can be played by starting it (no installation is required)

By default the console window's font settings might not be the best for the game. The following settings can be set on the following place:
1) Start the game
2) Right click on top of the console window
3) Properties
4) Font tab (Set everything here)
5) Click OK
6) Close the game
7) The settings should remain for this file until moving it to another place

WARNING: If the console window is not at least 80x35 (col x row) the game won't show properly and bugs can occour
Suggestion: For the best experience it's advised to:
- Set the console windows to exactly 80x35 (col x row)
- Change the font to "Raster Fonts" and size 12x16
## Control
The arrow keys and the Enter
## PS
This is the first really useable program/game I ever made (and that was a long time ago) so treat this stumbling (and hungarian) code of a child with care ;)
